title: Modern water heater gas valves leak by design

I am getting to the bottom of an issue that has puzzled me for years. New gas and propane water heater gas vavles smell like gas. Not a lot, but if you put your nose up to the valve and sniff, you can smell it. Plumbers on the whole don't seem to be specifically familiar with the cause, yet manufacturer support will tell you this is normal and expected.
